#### Bot Verification 

* Join the [RAIRPEPE Sneaker Boutique Telegram Group](https://t.me/+z4QT_lIFjmAyOTEx). After you join you'll see a message from [@XCPKickBot](https://t.me/XCPKickBot) asking you to verify your ownership of a `RAIRPEPE`
* Start a DM with the bot and send a message with the command `/start`. The bot will ask you to provide your Counterparty / Rare Pepe Wallet Address
* DM the bot your address. The bot will ask you to sign a message with your wallet to prove that you own this address
* Use the Sign Message feature in Rare Pepe Wallet, Freewallet or Counterwallet to sign the message (see below for more details)
* That's it! If you've sucessfully signed and you hold a `RAIRPEPE` you're good to go. If something went wrong, then the bot might get angry..
